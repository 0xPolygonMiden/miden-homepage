## Lighthouses: The Core of Miden’s Strategy 

<Scribble text="Scripted notes to add context / emphasis">
  We’re seeking Pioneers, exceptional teams capable of building groundbreaking
  products that leverage Miden’s unique features. These products, known as

## Supporting Pioneers 

Miden will provide robust support to teams developing Lighthouse products through:

3. VC Introductions: Connecting teams with venture capital through Miden’s investor network.
