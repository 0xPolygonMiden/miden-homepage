**The Pioneer Program provides projects support in three key areas:**

**<Highlight>Technical Support</Highlight>**
   - 1-on-1 Support
   - Issue prioritization
   - Direct Debugging Assistance

**<Highlight>Financial Support</Highlight>**

## Who We’re Looking For

- You have expertise in building and shipping crypto products with some level of product-market fit
- You have an audience, a reasonable product distribution channel, or a strategy for distribution
- You are highly driven to innovate through leveraging Miden’s core features to build the future of on-chain economies
- You are willing to take calculated risks, explore new ideas, and thrive in a rapidly developing ecosystem environment

Miden aims to support the development of innovative projects that solve real-world problems. Through the Pioneer Program, we focus on identifying teams capable of building Lighthouse applications.

## What is a Lighthouse Application?

Lighthouse applications showcase Miden’s core features and unique value proposition. By demonstrating what’s possible on Miden, these applications act as a “Lighthouse” for users, developers and the broader ecosystem.

We aim to launch on mainnet with five Lighthouse applications, each pushing the boundaries of what can be built in a scalable, private-by-default and secure on-chain environment.

The goals of a Lighthouse application are to:

1. Drive meaningful user activity to Miden
1. Provide valuable feedback to the core Miden team
1. Highlight ecosystem needs, such as wallets, oracles, and identity solutions

### What We’re Looking For

We are looking for applications with a clear user demand and the potential to scale. Some ideas we are excited about include:

**DeFi**

- Compliant dark pool
- Private order book / anonymous OTC trading
- Private asset management
- Private lending and borrowing protocol

**Payment**

- Private peer-to-peer payment (1-to-1)
- Private payroll automation (1-to-n)
- Point-of-sale tools and physical payment cards (e.g. a Miden-powered private credit card)

**Real World Assets**
- Private ownership and proof-of-ownership for real world assets

**Identity**
- Provable KYC
- Decentralized identity and compliance tooling

These are only starting points. If you’re building something uniquely suited to Miden’s features, we want to hear from you.
