# Pioneer program

Miden is preparing to launch its mainnet in late Summer 2025, with the vision of fostering widespread adoption through impactful, user-focused products. To achieve this, we aim to support the creation of innovative solutions that meet the following criteria:

- **<Highlight>Clear Product–Market Fit:</Highlight>** Solving real world problems and addressing significant user demand.
- **<Highlight>Robust Technical Foundation:</Highlight>** High-quality codebase combined with an intuitive user interface.
- **<Highlight>Strong Security and Compliance Standards:</Highlight>** Designed for reliability and regulatory compatibility

## What is a Miden Pioneer?

Pioneers are the first Miden builders, they are paving the way forward and have the first mover advantage towards building Miden’s core applications.

**We aim to support Pioneers in three main ways:**

1. <Highlight>Technical support</Highlight>

   - 1-1 calls;
   - issue prioritization;
   - debugging sessions.

1. <Highlight>Financial support</Highlight>

   - Grants;
   - RPGF;
   - RFP’s.

1. <Highlight>Business support</Highlight>

   - introductions to VC’s;
   - marketing;
   - legal;
   - business.

Our initial approach is to focus on onboarding solid teams to the Miden ecosystem, **A Miden Pioneer:**

- Has <Highlight>expertise in building</Highlight> and shipping products in crypto with a number of active users;
- Has a quality audience and a <Highlight>solid product distribution</Highlight> (e.g. Twitter, marketing).
- Is highly <Highlight>driven to innovate</Highlight> in the crypto space leveraging Miden’s features (scalability, privacy, etc.); and
- Is <Highlight>willing to take risks, explore ideas and can deliver</Highlight> and thrive while working in a novel ecosystem (e.g. lack of tooling, features, docs).

While we will support all builders, our focus will be put on supporting experienced teams who will build our Lighthouse applications.

## What is a Miden Lighthouse?

A Lighthouse application showcases Miden’s core features and it’s unique value proposition. It attracts builders and users by acting as a “Lighthouse”. They are the projects we are the most keen on supporting.

We aim to launch on mainnet with 10 Lighthouse applications.

The main goals for a Lighthouse application are:

1. Bring user activity to Miden
1. Provide valuable protocol feedback to the Miden core team
1. Indicate infrastructure needs (e.g. Oracle, Wallet)

Initially, we are looking for applications with a proven demand and a high number of users. Following are some ideas of Lighthouse applications:

- <Highlight>DeFi:</Highlight> Compliant dark pool
- <Highlight>DeFi:</Highlight> Private Order Book
- <Highlight>DeFi:</Highlight> Anonymous OTC trading and asset management
- <Highlight>DeFi:</Highlight> Private lending and borrowing market
- <Highlight>Payment:</Highlight> Easy-to-use private peer-to-peer payment (1-to-1
  payment)
- <Highlight>Payment:</Highlight> Private payroll (1-to-n payment)
- <Highlight>Payment:</Highlight> Private point-of-sale payment and physical cards
  (Miden private credit card)
- <Highlight>RWA:</Highlight> Private ownership and proof of ownership of real world
  assets
- <Highlight>Identity:</Highlight> Provable KYC, identity and compliance

But we are not limited to the above ones and willing to support if there are better ideas that can be built as Miden Lighthouse applications.

## Program Incentives

To support and incentivize builders, we’ve structured the program into two phases, providing funding and guidance at every step.

### Phase 1 – Early Contributors

This phase is designed to help builders explore ideas, develop a proof of concept (PoC), and showcase their potential.

**<Highlight>How It Works:</Highlight>**

1. Choose an Idea: Select a project to build on Miden, using Lighthouse applications for inspiration.
1. Register Your Team: Contact us to sign up as an aspiring Pioneer.
1. Build a PoC: Develop a proof of concept over three weeks.
1. Submit a Proposal: Outline your project and vision in a formal proposal during the final week of PoC development.
1. Evaluation: The Miden team reviews your proposal.
1. Legal Agreements: Sign the necessary documents to receive funding.
1. Grant: Independent of whether you continue building, you will receive a $20,000 grant for completing Phase 1.

### Phase 2 - Miden Pioneers (Grants up to $300K)

If both you and the Miden team decide to move forward after Phase 1, you’ll enter the Miden Pioneer program. This phase provides additional funding and long-term support for building production-ready applications.

**<Highlight>How It Works:</Highlight>**

1. **Milestone-Based Grants:** Grants of up to $300K will be structured around collaboratively defined development milestones.
1. **Risk Reduction:** The goal is to cover a significant portion of your development costs while minimizing financial risk.
1. **Ongoing Support:** Receive guidance, technical assistance, and ecosystem integration opportunities.
