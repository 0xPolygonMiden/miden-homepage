# Miden Raises $25M to Build the Edge Blockchain, Backed by a16z crypto, 1kx, and Hack VC

Today, we’re excited to announce that Miden has officially spun out of Polygon Labs after a successful incubation period that began in 2021. As an independent project, Miden will continue its evolution into a high performance blockchain designed for limitless scalability through a hybrid model of public and private transactions. This move grants the team greater sovereignty to fully realize Miden’s long-term vision.  

Led by Bobbin Threadbare, Domink Schmid and Azeem Khan, Miden joins Sui and Aptos as one of few blockchain projects headed by Facebook alumni. They lead a dynamic team with extensive experience from across Web3, including ConsenSys, Cosmos, Starknet, ZKSync, and Raiden Network. Miden recently closed a $25m funding round led by a16z crypto, 1kx, and Hack VC. The new capital will accelerate Miden’s development roadmap, from core protocol advancements to ecosystem expansion and developer tooling.

<Highlight>What does it mean to be an “edge blockchain”?</Highlight> On Miden, users can custody their own state and execute transactions locally at the edge, without relying on a centralized sequencer. This account-based model allows applications to scale virtually without limit, using a hybrid approach that supports both public and private transactions.

Built on this edge architecture, Miden reimagines blockchain design from first principles, combining Ethereum’s programmability with Bitcoin’s UTXO model in a ZK-native framework. It delivers the original promise of blockchain at scale. 

Now in its final alpha testnet phase, Miden supports a group of core builders through the Miden Pioneer program, an initiative designed to onboard early developers and stress-test the network through real use cases. Mainnet is expected to launch later this year.
